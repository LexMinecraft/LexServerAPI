=======================

### What is it?
Allows plugin-devs to create awesome plugins for multiple server-platforms with ease.

## License
I have chosen the MIT license for this project.

### Collaborators
The following teams of LexMinecraft have access to edit this repository: application-dev, mod-team.

### Things to Note
This is my first(?) API in Java, it may be good, it may not.

At this moment in time, there are no implementations of this API, for any server platform, I do however plan on making one for CanaryMod, and possible Sponge / Forge.
